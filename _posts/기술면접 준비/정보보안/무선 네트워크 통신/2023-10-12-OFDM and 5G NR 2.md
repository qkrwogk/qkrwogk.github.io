### MCS

#### Modulation and Coding

- **Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)**
- MCS 인덱스 테이블은 256QAM 지원 유무에 관계없이 가능한 모든 파형(CP-OFDM/DFT 확산 OFDM)에 대해 3GPP TS 38.214에서 제공된다.
- 각 MCS 인덱스는 변조 차수 및 코딩 속도에 해당한다.
- 코딩율은 1024비트의 물리 계층 블록에서 전송되는 계층 2비트의 수로 표현된다.
- MCS는 BLER(목표 재전송 확률)을 가정하여 링크 적응을 통해 스케줄러에 의해 결정된다. 10%.

#### DL

<img width="883" alt="스크린샷 2023-10-22 오후 5 15 58" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/138586629/277153138-1f07efaf-16c3-4133-81be-804ec2af0005.png">

#### Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH)

- Data Channel
  - PDSCH DMRS is needed for coherent demodulation
- MCS selection is based on CSI reports
- DL scheduler determine whose data is sent with how many physical resource blocks

<img width="398" alt="스크린샷 2023-10-22 오후 5 17 50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/138586629/277153212-f9ec090f-d10b-4c69-840c-46122b5014cb.png">

#### Reference Signals

- Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS)
  - PDSCH DMRS/PDCCH DMRS/PBCH DMRS
  - It is used by 5G NR receiver to produce channel estimates for demodulation of associated physical channel
- CSI-RS
  - Used for DL CSI (Channel State Information) acquisition
  - It is also used for signal strength measurements during mobility and beam management
  - It is configured specific to UE. But multiple users can also share the same resource – many configurations
  - CSI-RS can be periodic, semi-persistent or aperiodic
- Phase-Tracking RS
  - Especially,to compensate poor Phase Noise in mmWave

#### Control Channel : Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH)

- Carries “Downlink Control Information” (DCI)
  - Information to schedule (allocate physical resources) for Downlink Data (PDSCH)
  - Information to schedule (allocate physical resources) for Uplink Data (PUSCH)
  - Information to adjust Uplink Power (PUSCH, PUCCH power) for power control
- Earlier OFDM symbols are taken by PDCCH
  - PDCCH DMRS is needed for coherent demodulation
- Many formats : format 0_0 ~ 3_1
- Related concepts : Search space, Corset ...

#### Synchronization and System Information _중요_

#### CSI Measurement and Reporting

### Uplink (UL)

- Reference Signals
- Control Channels
- Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH)
- Link Adaptation and Power Control

#### Frame Structure

<img width="936" alt="스크린샷 2023-10-22 오후 5 28 59" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/138586629/277153678-5db9abfd-faed-4916-9c22-247897047ed3.png">

#### Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH)

- Uplink data channel
  - PUSCH DMRS is needed for coherent demodulation
- MCS and RB assignments are found at PDCCH
  - UL scheduler at gNB (Base Station) determines those based on SRS and PUCCH

<img width="401" alt="스크린샷 2023-10-22 오후 5 29 50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/138586629/277153700-53c26b27-31aa-44d2-9f9e-946dd3c12e02.png">

#### Reference Signals

- Demodulation Reference Signals
  - PUSCH DM-RS and PUCCH DM-RS
  - They are time-multiplexed with the data transmitted on PUSCH/PUCCH from the same device
- Phase-Tracking Reference Signals
  - For mmWave
- Sounding Reference Signals
  - enable the gNB to estimate the uplink channel

#### Control Channel : Physical Uplink Control CHannel (PUCCH)

- UCI is sent. UCI has tree things
  - Scheduling Request (SR) : I have some data to transmit in UL. Please consider me in UL scheduling
  - DL HARQ’s feedback – ACK or NACK
  - Channel State Information for DL scheduling – this can be sent in the traffic channel (=PUSCH)

#### Short PUCCH and self-contained slots

- Idea : If UE says “Well-received” early, then gNB can send the next packet immediately.
- Latency in NR can be further reduced through faster HARQ feedback, enabled by the introduction of short PUCCH.
- Compared to the “LTE-like” long PUCCH, the new short PUCCH enables the transmission of uplink control information (UCI) with only 1-2 OFDM symbols and flexible start positions within the slot.
- Short PUCCH is an enabler of the self-contained slots, where the payload together with the corresponding DCI and UCI is constrained and independently decodable within a slot, avoiding fixed timing relations between slots.
- With self-contained slots,latency is decreased since UL/DL scheduling, data, and HARQ feedback take place in the same slot.
